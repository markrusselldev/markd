## GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)

For GFM, you can _also_ use a plugin:
[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use).
It adds support for GitHub-specific extensions to the language:
tables, strikethrough, tasklists, and literal URLs.

These features **do not work by default**.
👆 Use the toggle above to add the plugin.

|    Feature | Support              |

| CommonMark | 100%                 |
|        GFM | 100% w/ `remark-gfm` |

## Made with `react-markdown`

`react-markdown` is a markdown component for React.

👉 Changes are re-rendered as you type.

👈 Try writing some markdown on the left.

## Overview

* Follows [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)
* Optionally follows [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
* Renders actual React elements instead of using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
* Lets you define your own components (to render `MyHeading` instead of `h1`)
* Has a lot of plugins

## Table of contents

Here is an example of a plugin in action
([`remark-toc`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc)).
This section is replaced by an actual table of contents.

## Syntax highlighting

Here is an example of a plugin to highlight code:
[`rehype-highlight`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight).

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'

ReactDOM.render(
  <ReactMarkdown rehypePlugins={[rehypeHighlight]}>{'# Your markdown here'}</ReactMarkdown>,
  document.querySelector('#content')
)
```

Pretty neat, eh?

## Inline Code

```
<script type="text/javascript">
  var user_name = document.getElementById("name");
</script>
```

## Components

You can pass components to change things:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'
import MyFancyRule from './components/my-fancy-rule.js'

ReactDOM.render(
  <ReactMarkdown
    components={{
      // Use h2s instead of h1s
      h1: 'h2',
      // Use a component instead of hrs
      hr: ({node, ...props}) => <MyFancyRule {...props} />
    }}
  >
    # Your markdown here
  </ReactMarkdown>,
  document.querySelector('#content')
)
```
